                            has been in production for 20 generations, but only now its appearance has noticeably changed. However,
                             the model still remains quite classic. Toyota, as is known, is quite conservative in terms of the exterior of its cars. 
                             Nevertheless, this does not prevent it from remaining the most sought-after brand in the world for many years.</p>

                             has changed quite significantly in appearance (not to mention the interior) over its 6 generations.

                             and in 2022 449 thousand. The reason for the sharp decline in sales can be easily explained overall 
                              the growing demand for electric cars. Even the hybrid version of the Honda CR-V cannot stop the decline in demand
                               for such a beautiful model by all measures.</p>
